Module 3(python) challenge

First challenge(PyBank) is a financial analysis to print change of profit/loss over few monts
    A text file analysis_result.txt is added to analysis folder to show the result
Second challenge(PyPoll) is to provide Election Result to print Total Votes, and how much each cadidate got and finally print the winner
I have 2 solutions for it, first worked on main.py    
    A text file analysis_vote.txt is added to analysis folder to show the result
Then I think I got a better solution which is in  main2.py (keeping both)  
    A text file analysis2_vote.txt is added to analysis folder to show the result
